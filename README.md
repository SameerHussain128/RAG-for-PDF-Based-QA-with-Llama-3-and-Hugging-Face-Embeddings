# RAG-for-PDF-Based-QA-with-Llama-3-and-Hugging-Face-Embeddings

# Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to ask questions about a PDF document and receive context-aware AI-generated responses. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector-based retrieval to extract relevant information efficiently.

# Goal
To build an AI system that extracts relevant information from a given PDF document and generates human-like responses using a powerful language model.

# Objectives:
1. Document Ingestion: Fetch a PDF file, extract text, and preprocess it for further use.
2. Text Chunking & Embeddings: Convert the document into smaller chunks and embed them using Hugging Face embeddings.
3. Vector Database Storage: Store the embedded chunks in a vector database (ChromaDB) for efficient retrieval.
4. Retrieval Mechanism: Fetch the most relevant text from the vector database based on user queries.
5. Response Generation: Use the Llama 3 model to generate responses based on retrieved text.
6. User Interaction: Enable users to ask questions about the document and receive accurate, context-aware answers.


## How It Works (Project Flow)
1. Fetch and Load PDF
* You download the PDF from a URL and save it locally.
* The UnstructuredFileLoader is used to extract text from the PDF.
2. Text Splitting & Preprocessing
* The text is split into smaller chunks (200 characters with 50-character overlap) using CharacterTextSplitter.
* Chunking ensures that retrieval works efficiently by breaking long documents into manageable pieces.
3. Embeddings & Vector Database
* Each text chunk is converted into an embedding (vector representation) using Hugging Face Embeddings.
* The embeddings are stored in ChromaDB, a vector database that enables efficient similarity searches.
4. Retrieval and Response Generation
* When the user asks a question, a similarity search is performed in the vector database.
* The retrieved text chunks are then passed to the Llama 3 model (hosted on Groq) to generate a response.
* The model generates an answer using both retrieved document data and its own knowledge.


# Technologies Used
* Document Processing: UnstructuredFileLoader
* Text Splitting: CharacterTextSplitter
* Embeddings: Hugging Face Embeddings
* Vector Database: ChromaDB
* LLM: Llama 3 (via Groq API)
  
# Real-World Applications
"This kind of system is widely used for:
* Chatbots that answer questions based on company documents.
* Legal or research assistants that summarize documents.
* Customer support systems that pull answers from manuals."
